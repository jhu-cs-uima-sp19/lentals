  Worked on Facebook Log-In
  Created Activities: MainActivity
  Created Res: activity_main.xml
  
  MainActivity currently just has the one "Continue with Facebook" button that will lead you to 
  sign into Facebook. After successful signin, it launches MainListings activity.
  NEED TO DO: If login was unsuccessful, what happens? Also Navigation drawer should include user profile 
  info in the header.

  Worked on basic navigation drawer and navigation functionality.
  Created Activities: MainListings, MyItems
  Created Res: nav_drawer_header.xml, nav_drawer_content.xml (menu), listings_main.xml -> listings_content.xml, 
  myitems_main.xml -> myitems_content.xml
  
  The listings_main.xml and myitems_main.xml contain the drawer layout and then they include their respective 
  content layouts. The navigation functionality works - can access MainListings and MyItems from the drawer. 
  Notes: Had to include a dependency to gradle for the Navigation View, had to update the styles.xml in order to use toolbar
  NEED TO DO: Implement the actual activities functionality.

  Worked on floating add button functionality.
  Created Activities: AddItem
  Created Res: additem.xml, added plus_sign.png
  
  The listings_content.xml and myitems_content.xml now include the floating add button. I also created AddItem screen
  currently just has a post and cancel button but otherwise empty. Added floating add button functionality - launches
  AddItem screen upon pressing. And post button launches MainListings and cancel button returns to previous screen.
  NEED TO DO: Input fields in AddItem screen. Create database for items.
