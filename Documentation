  Worked on Facebook Log-In
  Created Activities: MainActivity
  Created Res: activity_main.xml
  
  MainActivity currently just has the one "Continue with Facebook" button that will lead you to 
  sign into Facebook. After successful signin, it launches MainListings activity.
  NEED TO DO: If login was unsuccessful.

Jen - 11/4/19
  Worked on basic navigation drawer and navigation functionality.
  Created Activities: MainListings, MyItems
  Created Res: nav_drawer_header.xml, nav_drawer_content.xml (menu), listings_main.xml -> listings_content.xml, 
  myitems_main.xml -> myitems_content.xml
  
  The listings_main.xml and myitems_main.xml contain the drawer layout and then they include their respective 
  content layouts. The navigation functionality works - can access MainListings and MyItems from the drawer. 
  Notes: Had to include a dependency to gradle for the Navigation View, had to update the styles.xml in order to use toolbar
  NEED TO DO: Implement the actual activities functionality.
